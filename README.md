# trombi-front
Starter Angular Application (w/ french interface)

A sibling application of the famous [Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/tutorial) Angular tutorial, showing a list of persons (instead of Heroes), w/ french interface and modified CSS.

Configured to use a real nodejs/express backend, available at [trombi-back](https://github.com/dmolinarius/trombi-back).

FYI 'trombinoscope' means Facebook in french, hence the name of the repo ;-)

# trombi
Starter Angular Application (w/ french interface)

A sibling application of the famous [Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/tutorial) Angular tutorial, showing a list of persons (instead of Heroes), w/ french interface and modified CSS.

The [front](https://github.com/dmolinarius/trombi/tree/master/front) subdir holds the Angular code.

The app is actually configured to use a real nodejs/express REST backend (see [back](https://github.com/dmolinarius/trombi/tree/master/back) subdir).

FYI 'trombinoscope' means Facebook in french, hence the name of the repo ;-)
